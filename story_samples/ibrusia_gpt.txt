Scene 1: The Tension in Zaragoza
In the heart of Ibrusia, the capital city of Zaragoza brims with a mix of fear and determination. The bustling streets, once alive with the daily routines of its citizens, now echo with the hurried steps of military preparations. The air is thick with anticipation, as families gather their belongings, some choosing to flee while others resolve to stay.

In the central square, Governor Elena Martínez addresses a crowd of anxious citizens, her voice a mix of stern resolve and comforting assurance. "We stand at the brink of an invasion," she declares, "but our spirit remains unbroken. The Hosso Union may be at our gates, but they will find the hearts of Ibrusians unyielding!"

As she speaks, the distant rumble of artillery fire serves as a grim reminder of the approaching threat. The crowd listens, their faces a canvas of mixed emotions – fear, pride, uncertainty. Young soldiers, barely out of their teens, clutch their weapons, trying to mask their nervousness with a façade of bravery.

Above, the sky darkens, not just with the setting sun but also with the smoke billowing from distant fires, heralding the advance of the Hosso Union.

Scene 2: The Advance of the Hosso Union
Miles from Zaragoza, the vast and formidable forces of the Hosso Union march in unison, a seemingly unstoppable tide of military might. General Armand Volkov, a seasoned and ruthless leader, surveys the landscape before him with a steely gaze. His map is marked with strategic points around Zaragoza, each a critical step in his calculated plan to siege the city.

The air around the Hosso Union's camp is filled with the clanking of armor and the low murmur of soldiers preparing for battle. Tanks and artillery pieces are positioned, pointing ominously towards Zaragoza. Scouts return with reports, and officers gather around General Volkov, discussing their next move.

In the midst of this military encampment, a sense of grim determination prevails. Soldiers exchange glances, some with fervor in their eyes, others with a hint of doubt about the impending battle. General Volkov, ever the tactician, knows that the battle for Zaragoza will not just be fought with weapons, but also with wits and willpower.

As night falls, the lights of Zaragoza glimmer in the distance, a beacon of resistance against the dark silhouette of the approaching Hosso Union.
